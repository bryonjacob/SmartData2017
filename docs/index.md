<h2 id="setup-r">Setting up R Studio</h2>

1.  First, you need to make sure you have R installed:

    [https://cran.rstudio.com/](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

1.  Next, you can download and run the RStudio installer for your platform
    
    [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
   
1.  Once you have R and R Studio installed, we need to install the R package dependencies that this project depends upon - there is only one package we need to install, the `ggplot2` package.  From within R Studio, you can install it from the `Console` tab by typing:

    ```
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    ```
